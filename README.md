# EasyRPC
### EasyRPC is an Electron app for macOS, Windows, and Linux that allows users to easily set their Discord Rich Presence Status.
### It has a config for default strings, which can then be changed through the app at any time.

#### All instructions for setup, customization, and usage of EasyRPC are in our Wiki. [Press here to see it.](https://github.com/justdotJS/EasyRPC/wiki/)
